### 1. What is a vector space model, and why is it useful?

Vector space model or term vector model is an algebraic model for representing text documents (and any objects, in general) as vectors of identifiers, such as, for example, index terms. It is used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings.

### 2. 3. Consider the following collection of “documents” C:
  (i) It is what it is.
  (ii) Jean’s hat is finer than Karl’s hat.
  (iii) We are obsessing about gene issues.
  Build a vector space model for this collection.
