## Basics of Probability

a deck of 52 cards

P(ace) = 4/52 = 1/13
P(red) = 1/2
P(heart) = 1/4

### 1. Joint Probability(P(A,B))
  - P(ace,heart) = 1/4*1/13 = 1/52
  - P(heart,red) = 1/4  due to heart is in red
  
### 2. Conditional probability(P(A|B))  --- P(A∩B)/P(B)
  - P(ace|heart) = 1/13
  - P(heart|red) = 1/2
  
### 3. Conditional Probability
  - Sum rule: P(A) = Eb P(A∩B)
    -
