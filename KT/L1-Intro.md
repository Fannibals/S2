### Lecture 1: Introduction to Knowledge Technology

#### What is in a database?
+ what is in a database?
  - transactional data (cunsumer purchases)
  - sensor data (weather data)
  - measurement data (lab data)
  - accounting data
  -...
+ What is **NOT** in a database?
  - unstructured data

#### What to do with data?
+ Analysis and structure them by using computers
  - database schema
  - mark-up languages
  - programmatic APIs

+ what data satisfies a given pattern?
  - retrieve records, summary and visualization
+ what is computation for?
  - it is used for accompishing task
    - source of data
    - context, situation, assumptions
    - desired outcome

#### Concrete task
+ Computers and algorithms were originally developed to solve what might be called **concrete tasks**.
  - task is WELL DEFINED
  - we can assess whether the solution is correct. always one correct answer
  - Mechainical transformation of data can only very limitedly enhance human's knowledge

#### From Data => Information
+ **What Patterns satisfy this data?**  
**rather than what data satisfies a given pattern?**


### What is knowledge technology?
+ tasks where the data is irregualr or unreliable 
+ outcome is not well-defined
+ context is critical , we are using computers to  mediate between us and data
+ help us to make decisions and whereby enhance our knowledge

### What are some of its challenges?
### How to get from data to wisdom? 
classify, group, clustering === transfer from data to information

We want to understand the relationsip between each data point == data model --- knowledge
#### Characteristics of Knowledge Technologies
+ **General**: 
  - the data must be transformed to suit the axioms(公理) or assumptions of the method,    
    in a rigorous(缜密严谨的) way
  - A general problem: find features of the data items that discriminate between categories.

+ **Specific**: 
  - detailed understanding of the task is used to drive development of the method,    
                perhaps by drawing on a toolkit of components an of solutions to similar problems.
  - A specialized problem: parse a particular language.
                
#### Methods for data analysis
+ **Supervised Learning**
  * Classification
    - predicting a **discrete class**
  * Regresssion
    - predicting a **numeric quantity**
* **Discrete data** is counted ie.the number of students in the class  
**Continuous data** is measured ie. the height of a person

+ **Unsupervised Learning**
  * Association
    - detecting associations between features
  * Information organization; Clustering grouping similar instances into clsuters
  * Reinforcement learning
  * Recommender Systems
  * Anomaly/outlier detection
