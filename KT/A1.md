## KT-A1

### Abstract Summary

### 1. Introduction
+ The report is aim to find reasons why people made such sort of typograpical errors in the given data. 

+ Data set1:
	- The first data set is the list of common misspellng words that are used to correct typographical errors throughout Wikipedia
	- a list of 4453 tokens
	- Note: not all tokens are misspelling: 
		- song title(song writer intended)
		- transliteration

	- the data set this project use is a subset of the original one and also seperate to two docs(misspelling and correct)

+ Data set2:
	- A collection of computer-readable corpora of English spelling errors
	- a list of 34683 misspellings
	- It includes the results of spelling tests and errors from free writing, taken mostly from schoolchildren, university students or adult literacy students. Most of them were originally handwritten.

	- Users of this corpus should bear in mind that it includes the efforts of young children and extremely poor spellers being subjected to spelling tests way beyond their ability, so some of the misspellings are very different from their targets; the single letter "o", for example, appears as a misspelling of the word "accordingly".

+ State of art
	- 

### 2. Methodology

+ Hypotheses
	- cause(s) of typographical errors
	- one or more spelling correction methods
	- implementation process


+ Critical Analysis
	- Effective of system
	- **Evaluate hypotheses**
		- Evaluation
			- Precision: fraction of correct responses among attempted responses
			- Recall: proportion of words with a correct response (somewhere)
+ Conlcusion
