## KT-A1

### 1. Introduction(150)
+ The report is aim to find reasons why people made such sort of typograpical errors in the given data. 

+ Data set used in the report:
	- The first data set is the list of common misspellng words that are used to correct typographical errors throughout Wikipedia
	- a list of 4453 tokens
	- Note: not all tokens are misspelling: 
		- song title(song writer intended)
		- transliteration

	- the data set this project use is a subset of the original one and also seperate to two docs(misspelling and correct)

+ State of art


### 2. Methodology(500)

+ Hypothese
	- cause(s) of typographical errors **(100)**
		- 1) Hitting a neighbouring key instead, due to poor muscle memory
			- ie. typing "Byt" instead of "But"
		- 2) Reversing two letters, possibly due to fast typing 
			- ie. typing "teh" instead of "the"
		- 3) adding extra letters / typing less letters
			- ie. typing "teth" instead of "teeth"
+ one or more spelling correction methods **(300**)
	- Soundex
		- Soundex uses codes based on the sound of each letter to translate a string into a canonical form of at most four characters, preserving the first letter.
	- N-gram
		- string distance measures based on N-gram counts, where a N-gram of string s is any substring of s of some fixed length N.
	- Edit distances
		- Given two character strings s1 and s2, the edit distance between them is the minimum number of edit operations(insertion, deletion, replacement) required to transform s1 into s2. 
		- Levenshtein distance(0111) 
		- GED(-1111) actually not the distance
		- Damerau–Levenshtein distance

+ implementation process
	- Take Levenshtein distance as the benchmark
	- **Evaluate hypotheses**
		- Evaluation
			- Precision: fraction of correct responses among attempted responses
			- Recall: proportion of words with a correct response (somewhere)

### 3. Critical Analysis(700)
+ 1) Hitting neighbourhood
	- analyze on results
	- Effective of system
	- 
	
+ 2) Reversing two letters
	- Damerau–Levenshtein distance

+ 3) adding extra letters / typing less letters
	- Soundex
