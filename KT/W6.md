# Introduction to Data Mining and Machine Learning

## Data Mining
### Definition
+ Extracting data that:
	- implicit
	- previously unknown
	- potentially useful
+ programs needed to detect patterns and regularities in the data
	- only strong patterns for good predictions

## Machine Learning
### Definitions
+ Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicity programmed.

+ the algorithms for acquiring structural descriptions from examples:
	- Structural descriptions **represent patterns explicitly**
	- Can be used to **predict outcome in new situation**
	-  Can be used to **understand and explain how prediction is derived(most important)**

### Types of ML algorithms
#### 1. Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
+ Supervised
	- sets of examples 
	- lables -- answers (outcomes)
	- examples: classificatin 

+ Unsupervised 
	- no outcomes --- lables

#### 2. Data Mining vs. Machine Learning
+ Difference: **Not cut-and-dried**
+ Data mining: **Knowledge obtained from data**
+ Machine learning: **Techiniques used to learn from data**

## Tasks and Problems
### Machine Learning applications
+ Cluster Analysis
+ Association Analysis
+ Predictive Modeling
+ Anomaly Detection

### Types of applications
+ supervised
	- classification
		- discrete class
		- **example**
	- regression
		- numeric quantity(predicting house prices)
		- **example**
+ unsupervised
	- assoication
	- clustering
	- reinforcement learning ?
	- recommender systems ?
	- anomaly detection ?


## ML concepts
### Core Definitions
+ input to a ML system consists of 
	- instances	- **rows**
	- attributes(features) - **columns**
	- concepts

### attributes
+ nominal
	- A categorical variable is one that has two or more categories, but there is no intrinsic ordering to the categories.  
	- For example, **gender** is a categorical variable having two categories (male and female) and there is no intrinsic ordering to the categories. 
+ ordinal
	- a clear ordering of the variables.
	- Example: ranking
	- no distance between values defined
+ continuous(numeric)
	- real-valued
	- no explicit upper bound 
	- 0 has meaning
	- Example: a person's weight or age
