## Lecture 2: Document representation and String processing

### 1. Structured/Semi-structured/Unstructured Data
+ **Unstructured data**
  - Data without regular, decomposable internal structure (cannot understanded by computers)
  - examples: blogs(structured by bloggers), MP3 files, JPEG files
+ **Structured data**
  - Data which strictly conforms to a schema
  - traditional DBs
  - examples: ABN lookup, library catalogues
+ **Semi-structured data**
  - some parts are structured 
  - examples: Wikipedia entries, Bibtex records, bibliography
  

### Structure type exercise
+ Web pages &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Semi-structured**
  - markup languages => **structured** 
  - but content is **unstructured**
+ Excel spreadsheet  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Semi-structured OR Structured**
  - depends on what can insert into the column, like **comment(content with flexibility)** then semi
+ Electronic Health Record &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Structured OR Semi-Structured**
+ Email &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Semi-structured**
+ Video&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Unstructured**
+ Student marks database &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Structured OR Semi** 

### 2. Regular expressions
+ Search (grep family)
```
> egrep 'rudd' *.txt    // finding txt files that include string 'rudd'
> egrep 'col(o|ou)r' *.txt
```
+ Find and replace : using in Vim
```
:%s/rudd/gillard/g      // replacing rudd as gillard
```
+ Validate or test : check if new string is correct
```
>$input =~ /gillard/
>$input =~ /^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}$/
```

### 

+ metacharacters
  - ( ) [ ] { } . * + ? ^ $ | \ 
  - use **\** to match them
  - \\ => \
  - \$ => $
+ matching 
  - literal matching
    - /knowledge/
    - each character matches itself
    - case sensitive
  - /over priced/ != /overpriced/
  - /lane/ matches "planet"
  - wildcard . matches any single character
  - ^ and $ are fro the start and end 
  ```
  > egrep '^.n.wl.d..$' ... /local/words.txt
  knowledge
  ```
