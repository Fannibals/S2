## Lecture 2: Document representation and String processing

### 1. Structured/Semi-structured/Unstructured Data
+ **Unstructured data**
  - Data without regular, decomposable internal structure (cannot understanded by computers)
  - examples: blogs(structured by bloggers), MP3 files, JPEG files
+ **Structured data**
  - Data which strictly conforms to a schema
  - traditional DBs
  - examples: ABN lookup, library catalogues
+ **Semi-structured data**
  - some parts are structured 
  - examples: Wikipedia entries, Bibtex records, bibliography
  

### Structure type exercise
+ Web pages &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Semi-structured**
  - markup languages => **structured** 
  - but content is **unstructured**
+ Excel spreadsheet  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  **Semi-structured OR Structured**
  - depends on what can insert into the column, like **comment(content with flexibility)** then semi
+ Electronic Health Record &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Structured OR Semi-Structured**
+ Email &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Semi-structured**
+ Video&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Unstructured**
+ Student marks database &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Structured OR Semi** 

### 2. Regular expressions
+ Search (grep family)
```
> egrep 'rudd' *.txt    // finding txt files that include string 'rudd'
> egrep 'col(o|ou)r' *.txt
```
+ Find and replace : using in Vim
```
:%s/rudd/gillard/g      // replacing rudd as gillard
```
+ Validate or test : check if new string is correct
```
>$input =~ /gillard/
>$input =~ /^[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}$/
```

### 

+ **metacharacters**
  - ( ) [ ] { } . * + ? ^ $ | \ 
  - use **\** to match them
  - \\\ => \
  - \\$ => $
+ **matching** 
  - literal matching
    - /knowledge/
    - each character matches itself
    - case sensitive
  - /over priced/ != /overpriced/
  - /lane/ matches "planet"
  - wildcard . matches any single character
  - ^ and $ are fro the start and end 
    ```
    > egrep '^.n.wl.d..$' ... /local/words.txt
      knowledge
    ```

+ **Alternation**
  - examples
    ```
    /a|b|c/ matches “a”, “b”, or “c”.
    /cat|dog/ matches “cat” or “dog”.
    /\$(US|AU|CD)/ matches “$US”, “$AU”, or “$CD”.
    ```
  - "|" has low precedence

+ **Repetition**
  - Some repetitions involve an arbitrary number:
    - *: zero or more of the preceding element
    - ?: zero or one of the preceding element
    - +: one or more of the preceding element
  - others
    - {n}: exactly n of the preceding element
    - {m,n}: between m and n (inclusive) of the preceding element
    - {n,}: n or more of the preceding element
    - {,m}: up to m of the preceding element

+ **Character Classes**
  - some examples
    - /[Kk]nowledge/
    - /[aeiou]/ –note that this is equivalent to /a|e|i|o|u/ or
    - /(a|e|i|o|u)/
    - /^\$[0-9]+/    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; price
    - /^[A-Z][a-z]*/
    - / [A-Za-z]+ /

+ **Negative Classes**
  - examples: // ^ is in brackets
    - /[^0-9]/  $nbsp;$nbsp;$nbsp; Everything expect 0-9
    - /[^"]/
    - /<[^>]>/

+ **Named Classes**
  - some useful uses
    - [0-9] = [[:digit:]] = \d
    - [a-zA-Z0-9_] = [[:word:]] = \w
    - [\ \t\r\n\f] = [[:space:]] = \s
  - As do their negations:
    - [^0-9] = \D
    - [^a-zA-Z0-9_] = \W
    - [^\ \t\r\n\f] = \S

+ **Back-references or memoization**  
  - If refers to what was matched in the first set of parentheses, the first group. Subsequent number means subsequent parentheses.
  - \1 --- the first stored pattern
    ```
    (1|2)(3|4)\1\2
    ```
  - Would match:
    ```
    1313
    1414
    2323
    2424
    ```
