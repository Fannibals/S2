## Lecture 1: Introduction to Distributed Systems and Characterisation

### This subject aims:
+ to cover characteristics of networked computers that  
  impact system designers and implementers
+ to present the main concepts and techniques that have been developed to help  
  in the tasks of designing and implementing systems and applications that are  
  based on networks


### 1. Distributed Systems

#### Definition
+ A system in which hardware or software components located at **networked** computers  
  communicates and coordinate their actions only by **message passing**
+ A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to  
  the users of the 

### 2. Networks vs. Distributed Systems
+ **Networks**: A media for interconnecting local and wide area computers and exchange messages  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; based on protocols. Network entities are visible and they are explicitly addressed
  - Networks focuses on packets, routing, etc.
+ **Distributed System**: existence of multiple autonomous computers is transparent
  - DS relies on services provided by a computer network
  
  
### 3. Reasons for Distributed Systems
+ Functional Separation
+ Inherent distribution
+ Power imbalance and load variation
+ Reliability
+ Economies


### 4. Consequences of Distributed Systems
+ Concurrency
+ Heterogeneity
+ No global clock
+ Independent Failures

### 5. Characteristics of DS
+ Parallel activities
+ Communication via message
+ Resource sharing
+ No global state
+ No global clock

### 6. Goals of DS
+ Connecting Users and Resources
+ Transparency
+ Openness
+ Scalability
+ Enhanced Availability

### 7. Diff with Parellel systems
+ Extensibility of clusters leads to heterogeneity
  - Adding additional nodes as requirements grow
+ Extending clusters to include user desktops by harnessing their idle resources
  - E.g., SETI@Home, Folding@Home
+ Leading to the rapid convergence of various concepts of parallel and distributed systems

### 8. Examples
+ Web
+ Data centers an Clouds
+ ...
