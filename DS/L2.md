### Lecture 2: Inter-Process Communication: Network Programming using TCP Java Sockets

1. Introduction
+ increasing demand of internet applications
+ Object-oriented Java technologies— **Sockets**, threads, RMI, clustering, Web services—  
have emerged as leading solutions for creating portable, efficient, and   
maintainable large and complex Internet applications


2. Networking Basics
+ Client -Server Communication
  - Generally, programs running on client machines make requests to a program running on a server machine. 
  - programs involve TCP and UDP (Transport layer)
  
+ | |TCP|UDP|
  |---|---|---|
  |service type of protocol |connecition-oriented protocol| connectionless protocol|
  |Example apps using the service|Http, FTP, Telnet| Clock Server, Ping|
  
  
3. Understanding Ports and Sockets
+ Ports
  - The TCP and UDP protocols **use ports to map incoming data to a particular process** running on a
computer. 
  - Port is represented by a positive (16-bit) integer value. 
  - Some ports have been reserved to support common/well known services:
    - ftp ---  21/tcp 
    - telnet ---  23/tcp
    - smtp --- 25/tcp
    - login --- 513/tcp
    - http --- 80/tcp,udp
    - https --- 443/tcp,udp

+ Sockets
  - Sockets **provide an interface** for programming networks at the transport layer
  - similar to performing file I/O
  - Socket-based communication is **programming language independent**.
