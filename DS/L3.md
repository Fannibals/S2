## Multithreaded Programming using Java Threads

### 1. Introduction to Middleware
+ Middleware 
  - is a layer of software system between applications and OS powering the nodes of a distributed system
  - Applications and services use the middleware layer for their interactions
  - Middleware enables remote communication between objects or processes at the nodes of a DS.
  
+ NOS and DOS
  - NOS: They have a networking capability built into them and so can be used to access remote resources.
    - UNIX, Windows -- retain autonomy
  - DOS: An operating system that produces a single system image like this for all the resources in a distributed system is called a distributed operating system
+ Operating system
  - Task: to provide problem-oriented abstractions of the underlying physical resources 
    – the processors, memory, networks, and storage media.
 
  - Encapulation
    - provide a useful service interface to their resources(operations that meet needs)
    - Details such as management of memory and devices used to implement resources should be hidden from clients.
  - protection
    - Resources require protection from illegitimate accesses
  - concurrent processing
    - Clients may share resources and access them concurrently. Resource managers are responsible for achieving concurrency transparency.

+ Core OS functionality

  - Process manager: Creation of and operations upon processes. A process is a unit of resource management, including an address space and one or more threads.
  - Thread manager: Thread creation, synchronization and scheduling. Threads are schedulable activities attached to processes.
  - Communication manager: Communication between threads attached to different processes on the same computer. Some kernels also support communication between threads in remote processes. Other kernels have no notion of other computers built into them, and an additional service is required for external communication.
  - Memory manager: Management of physical and virtual memory.
  - Supervisor: Dispatching of interrupts, system call traps and other exceptions; control of memory management unit and hardware caches; processor and floating-point unit register manipulations. This is known as the Hardware Abstraction Layer in Windows.

### 4. Java Threads and States
  - Multithread Programming with Java

+ Defining Threads
	- A process is a program in execution
	- A process may be divided into a number of independent units
		- A thread is a dispathable unit of work

+ Threads in Java
	- All threads within a process share the same state and memory space
	- can communicate with each other directly(share same variables)

+ Threads can be created by:
	- 1. Create a class that extends the standard Thread class.
		- 
```
/* ThreadEx1.java: A simple program creating and invoking a thread object by
extending the standard Thread class. */
class MyThread extends Thread {
   public void run() {
      System.out.println(“ this thread is running ... ”);
  }
} 
class ThreadEx1 {
   public static void main(String [] args  ) {
     MyThread t = new MyThread();
t.start(); }
}
```

	- 2. Create a class that implements the standard Runnable interface.
```
class MyThread2 implements Runnable {
    public void run(){
        System.out.println(" Mythread2 is running...");
    }
}

class ThreadEx2{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new MyThread2());
        t.start();
    }
}
```
+ Thread Class vs. Runnnable interface
	- By extending the thread class, the derived class itself is a thread object and it gains full control over the thread life cycle.
	- if the program needs a full control over the thread life cycle, extending the Thread class is a good choice
	- if the program needs more flexibility of extending other base classes, implementing the Runnable interface would be preferable.
