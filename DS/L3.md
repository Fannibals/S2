## Multithreaded Programming using Java Threads

### 1. Introduction to Middleware
+ Middleware 
  - is a layer of software system between applications and OS powering the nodes of a distributed system
  - Applications and services use the middleware layer for their interactions
  - Middleware enables remote communication between objects or processes at the nodes of a DS.
  
+ NOS and DOS
  - NOS: They have a networking capability built into them and so can be used to access remote resources.
    - UNIX, Windows -- retain autonomy
  - DOS: An operating system that produces a single system image like this for all the resources in a distributed system is called a distributed operating system
+ Operating system
  - Task: to provide problem-oriented abstractions of the underlying physical resources 
    â€“ the processors, memory, networks, and storage media.
 
  - Encapulation
    - provide a useful service interface to their resources(operations that meet needs)
    - Details such as management of memory and devices used to implement resources should be hidden from clients.
  - protection
    - Resources require protection from illegitimate accesses
  - concurrent processing
    - Clients may share resources and access them concurrently. Resource managers are responsible for achieving concurrency transparency.

+ Core OS functionality

  - Process manager: Creation of and operations upon processes. A process is a unit of resource management, including an address space and one or more threads.
  - Thread manager: Thread creation, synchronization and scheduling. Threads are schedulable activities attached to processes.
  - Communication manager: Communication between threads attached to different processes on the same computer. Some kernels also support communication between threads in remote processes. Other kernels have no notion of other computers built into them, and an additional service is required for external communication.
  - Memory manager: Management of physical and virtual memory.
  - Supervisor: Dispatching of interrupts, system call traps and other exceptions; control of memory management unit and hardware caches; processor and floating-point unit register manipulations. This is known as the Hardware Abstraction Layer in Windows.
