## Lecture 1: Introduction to Distributed Systems and Characterisation

### This subject aims:
+ to cover characteristics of networked computers that  
  impact system designers and implementers
+ to present the main concepts and techniques that have been developed to help  
  in the tasks of designing and implementing systems and applications that are  
  based on networks


### 1. Distributed Systems

#### Definition
+ A system in which hardware or software components located at **networked** computers  
  communicates and coordinate their actions only by **message passing**
+ A distributed system is a collection of **independent** computers that **appear to**  
  the users of the system as a single computer.
  
+ **Example**
  - Cluster:
    - “A type of parallel or distributed processing system, which consists of a collection of **interconnected stand-alone    computers** cooperatively **working together** as a single, integrated computing resource” [Buyya].


### 2. Networks vs. Distributed Systems
+ **Networks**: A media for interconnecting local and wide area computers and exchange messages  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; based on protocols. Network entities are visible and they are explicitly addressed by IP address.
  - Networks focuses on packets, routing, etc.
+ **Distributed System**: existence of multiple autonomous computers is transparent
  - DS relies on services provided by a computer network
  
  
### 3. Reasons for Distributed Systems
+ **Functional Separation**
  - Existence of computers with different capabilities and purposes
  - Beneficial to separae collection from processing
+ **Inherent distribution**
  - The process/activity is naturally distributed
  - Information, people
+ **Power imbalance and load variation**
  - Distribute computational load among different computers.
  - We are forced to use DS as one system cannot handle!
+ **Reliability**
  - Long term preservation and data backup (replication) at different locations.
+ **Economies**
  - Share resources ==> reduce cost, statistical multiplexing


### 4. Consequences of Distributed Systems
+ **Concurrency**
  - A can do the his work on A's computer while B can do his work on B's computer  
    and A and B can share resources like web pages or file when necessary.
+ **Heterogeneity**
  - Different hardware, different software, different protocols
+ **No global clock**
  - there are limits to the accuracy with which the computers in a network can synchronize their clocks –  
    there is no single global notion of the correct time.
  - This is a direct consequence of the fact that the only communication is by sending messages through a network.
+ **Independent Failures**
  - Each component of the system can fail independently
  - Faults in the network result in the isolation of the computers that are connected to it, but that doesn’t mean that they stop running.
  - In fact, programs on them may not be able to detect whether the network has failed or has become unusually slow.


### 5. Characteristics of DS
+ **Parallel activities**
  - Autonomous components executing concurrent tasks
+ **Communication via message**
  - No shared memory
+ **Resource sharing**
  - printer, database etc.
+ **No global state**
  - No single process can have knowledge of the current global state of the system
+ **No global clock**
  - Only limited precision for processes to synchronize their clocks

#### Four Reasons of Resource Sharing
+ reduce cost
+ facilitates interactions among users
+ increase capacity
+ increase availability

### 6. Goals of DS
+ Connecting Users and Resources
  - widely available
+ Transparency
  - user only need to know how to use rather than the complexity behind
+ Openness
  - anyone can interface with, understand and extend system
+ Scalability
+ Enhanced Availability

### 7. Diff with Parellel systems
+ Extensibility of clusters leads to heterogeneity
  - Adding additional nodes as requirements grow
+ Extending clusters to include user desktops by harnessing their idle resources
  - E.g., SETI@Home, Folding@Home
+ Leading to the rapid convergence of various concepts of parallel and distributed systems

### 8. Examples
+ Web
+ Data centers an Clouds
+ ...

+ Financial Trading example
  - The financial industry has long been at the cutting edge（前沿） of distributed systems technology with its need, in particular, for real-time access to a wide range of information sources
  - distributed event-based systems
    - events such as: a drop in a share price / the release of the latest unemployment figures, and so on.
    - event input ==> the problem of heterogeneity (different technologies)

### 10. Challenges
+ **Heterogeneity**
  - Heterogeneous components must be able to interoperate
    - Different OS, hardware, programming languages, etc.
+ **Distribution transparency**
  - Distribution should be hidden from the user as much as possible
    - Access transparency(OS), Location transparency(DNS), Failure transparency 
    - Replication transparency(DNS), Migration transparency
    - Concurrency, performance, scaling, application level transparencies
+ **Fault tolerance**
  - Failure of a component (partial failure) should not result in failure of the whole system
+ **Scalability**
  -  A system is described as scalable if it will remain effective when there is a significant increase in the number of resources and the number of users.
  - Challenges for designing a scalable DS:
    - Controlling the cost of physical resources
    - Controlling the performance loss
    - Preventing software resources running out
    - 
+ **Concurrency**
  - Shared access to resources must be possible
    - Provide and manage concurrent access to shared resources
+ **Openness**
  - Interfaces should be publicly available to ease inclusion of new components
  - extend at hardware level or software level
  - To summarize:
    - • Open systems are characterized by the fact that their key interfaces are published.
    - • Open distributed systems are based on the provision of a uniform communication mechanism and published interfaces for accessto shared resources.
    - • Open distributed systems can be constructed from heterogeneous hardware and software, possibly from different vendors.  Butthe conformance of each component to the published standard must be carefully tested and verified if the system is to work correctly.
    
+ **Security**
  - The system should only be used in the way intended
    - Confidentiality
      - protection against disclosure to unauthorized individuals
    - Integrity
      - protection against alteration or corruption
    - Availability
      - protection against interference with the means to access the resources
    - Non-repudiation
      - through Encryption, Authentication, Authorization
