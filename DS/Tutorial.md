## Tutorial 1

### 1. Provide a definition of a Distributed System
  + A system in which hardware or software components located at networked computers  
  communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing message.
  + A collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system

### 2. Briefly explain the difference between a computer network and a distributed system.
  + **A Computer Network** is a collection of spatially separated, interconnected computers that  
  exchange messages based on specific protocols. Computers are addressed by IP addresses.
  
  + **Distributed System** means Multiple computers on the network working together as a system.  
  The spatial separation of computers and communication aspects are hidden from users.

### 3. List three reasons for using a distributed system
  + Funcitonal Separation
  + Inherent distribution
  + Reliability
  + Economy
  
### 4. Briefly explain four consequences when using distributed systems.
+ **Concurrency**
  - A can do the his work on A's computer while B can do his work on B's computer  
    and A and B can share resources like web pages or file when necessary.
+ **Heterogeneity**
  - Different hardware, different software, different protocols
+ **No global clock**
  - there are limits to the accuracy with which the computers in a network can synchronize their clocks â€“  
    there is no single global notion of the correct time.
  - This is a direct consequence of the fact that the only communication is by sending messages through a network.
+ **Independent Failures**
  - Each component of the system can fail independently, leaving the others still running.
