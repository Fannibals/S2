### Lecture 1: Introduction to Knowledge Technology

#### What is a database?
+ what is in a database?
+ What is **NOT** in a database?

#### What is knowledge technology?
#### What are some of its challenges?
#### How to get from data to wisdom?

#### Characteristics of Knowledge Technologies
+ **General**: the data must be transformed to suit the axioms or assumptions of the method,  
              in a rigorous way
+ **Specific**: detailed understanding of the task is used to drive development of the method,  
                perhaps by drawing on a toolkit of components an of solutions to similar problems.
                
#### Methods for data analysis
+ **Supervised Learning**
  * Classification
    - predicting a discrete class 
  * Regresssion
    - predicting a numeric quantity
* **Discrete data** is counted ie.the number of students in the class  
**Continuous data** is measured ie. the height of a person

+ **Unsupervised Learning**
  * Association
    - detecting associations between features
  * Information organization; Clustering grouping similar instances into clsuters
  * Reinforcement learning
  * Recommender Systems
  * Anomaly/outlier detection
