## Lecture 2: Project Management Plan & SDLC’s

1. Understand what a Process is and its relevance to Project Management.
+ **Process**
  - Definition: A process is a series of **progressive and interdependent** steps by which an end is attained 
+ Project Management
  - A process as it defines a series of tasks to deliver a specific outcome
  
+ System Development Lifecycle(SDLC)
  - A process for planning, creating, testing and deploying an information system
  - SDLC can be composed of hardware, software or both



2. Understand what a Project Management Plan (PMP) is and when it should be used.

+ Project Management Plan
  - A PMP is a formal approved document that defines how the project is executed, monitored and controlled
  - a summary or a detailed doc that is **owned, controlled and populated**  
    by the Project Manager and is used throughout the project.
  - can provide needed information across key components of the project

+ Project Charter vs. PMP
  - A Project Charter is a **summary project proposal** to secure **approval for the project goals and terms**  
  (useful as part of Business Case).
  - A PMP is an approved document showing **how to achieve the approved project goals / benefits** and provides the **details on how to execute and manage the project**  
  (used as part of mobilisation and on-going management of the project).

3. Understand the components of a Project Management Plan.
+ Project Information
  - Executive Summary
  - Financial Authority to proceed
  - Key Stakeholders 
  - Scope
  - Delivery approach / SDLC - Waterfall or Agile
  - Resources / People
  - Key Milestones  里程碑
  - Project Budget
  - Business Value (Financial & Non-Financial Benefits)
  - Lessons learned applied to this project
  - Constraints (time, process)
+ Project Governance
  - Roles and Responsibilities
  - Mandatory Project Planning / Key Additional Activities
    - Schedule 
    - Risk Management
    - Cost Estimation
    - Quality Assurance
    - Configuration Management (Change Management)


4. Understand what a **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** is and the advantages / disadvantages of various models.

+ Activities
  - Requirements gathering 
  - System / Architectural Design
  - Implementation / coding 
  - Integration
  - Testing
  - Delivery and Release - Deployment
  - Maintenance
  
+ |Formal Processes|Agile Processes|
  |-----|-----|
  |- Waterfall | - Extreme Programming|
  |- Incremental | - Scrum|
  |- V-Model      |- Kanban|

+ SDLC - Waterfall
  - |Advantages|Disadvantages|
    |----|-----|
    |Simple and easy to understand and use|Difficult to accommodate change after the process in underway|
    |Easy to manage (rigidity)| Difficult to integrate risk management due to uncertainty|
    |Phases are processed and completed one at a time| One phase must be completed before moving on to the next|
    |Documentation available at the end of each phase|Unclear requirements lead to confusion|
    |Works well for projects where requirements are very well understood and remain stable|Clients approval is in the final stage|


5. Understand what Agile is and its origins.





6. Understand the Agile framework.






7. Understand Scrum – Roles, Ceremonies and Artefacts.







8. Understand advantages / disadvantages of Agile.







9. Understand key questions that will help select which approach to use and some examples.
