## Lecture 6 Project Scheduling

### 1. The project charter comes at the end of the initiating stage
+ A project charter (PC) is a document that states a project exists and provides the project manager with written authority to begin work.

+ The project management plan comes after the planning

### Why project always fail?
+ Lack of a scope document
+ inconsistent Communication
+ Unrealistic expectations and deadlines
+ Incompetent Project Manager and Team
+ lack of cohesion between team members
+ Poor Monitoring and Risk Management
+ Poor Planning

### Project Planning
+ Project Scheduling
+ Cost Estimation
+ Risk Management
+ Quality Management
+ Configuration Management (Change Management)
+ Resource Management
+ Communication Management

### **Project Planning and Scheduling**
+ Project Schedule is used and maintained throughout the project to monitor and track project progress 
	- a living document
+ Contains:
	- **Tasks** that need to be completed
	- **Duration and dependencies** for each task
	- **People and physical resources** required by each task
	- **Milestones** and **deliverable**(sth that you can put out to output parties)
	- **Project Timeline**

+ Constraints
	- Traditional project management is built upon the basis of the triple constraints of time, cost and scope.
	- Agile
		- cost(developers) and time(deadline) => scope
		- value/vision driven

#### Steps to develop project schedule
##### 1. Breakdown the task into small chunks you can deal with â€“ **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
#####2. Identify the **interdependencies** between the broken down tasks and develop a task network
+ tasks
	- unconstrained
	- constrained
+ **Dependencies are caused by:**
		- a task needing a work product of another task
		- a task needs resources used by another task
+ Types of Task Dependencies
	- Finish-to-Start
	- Start-to-Start
	- Finish-to-Finish
	- Start-to-Finish

##### 3. Estimate the **effort** and the **time allocation** for each task
+ person-months
	- the time in months for a single person working full time to complete the task
	
+ Time Estimation
	- **Terminology**
		- optimistic time 
		- pessimistic time
		- most likely time
		- expected time
##### 4. **Allocate resources** for tasks and validate effort
##### 5. Develop the **project schedule**
