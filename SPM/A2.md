# SWEN90016 Group Assignment

## 5.3 Delivery Approach, SDLC
+ The Agile Scrum method is chosen as the SDLC model for this project. 

+ **Requirement Stability**
	- The agile model responses rapidly for changing in requirements, which enables quick adjustments to changes in requirements. Changes are inevitable, therefore, ability to handle changes will reduce the risk that this project off tracks from the original plan.

+ **Participation**
	- Higher participation of the work, for instance frequent team meetings and client meetings are enabled by the model. Hence, customers, developers and testers can interact with each other for conquering problems of the project constantly to make sure the high product quality.

+ **Scrum**
	- Development of the software will be implemented through five sprints, each of two weeks. 

+ This was chosen with reference to the de facto industry standards. It is shorter than the PMP Sprint as the team deemed it necessary to review work more frequently, due to team member inexperience in the development processes. During each of these Sprints, chunks of working software will be developed relating to some of the identified desired features, as explained in the previous section. 

+ The team plans to manage and control the project through weekly team meetings which would allow members to raise any concerns encountered and give a report about their progress.
